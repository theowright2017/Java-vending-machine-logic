There are some errors in this repo that I need to amend once I get time.
The app itself works, however, then main issue I have is that i need to amend the Slot class to only take in a SlotCode, and 
this will enable me to remove the need for an Empty Product Object.

Currently my slot is intially populated with empty objects, and replaced as needed, which is obviously not an ideal approach. 
I took this approach initially as i suffered from lack of real depth in planning.
